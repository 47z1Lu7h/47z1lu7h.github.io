##### Hey there!! This is my avatar, **atziluth** . I know it’s written a bit cryptic... I like the hack style of rename things... hehehe :sweat_smile:

<br>

#### `This is my personal corner of the internet. I recently finished my Certificate of Higher Education (HNC), in Systems Administration, and during the first year of the course, I discovered my passion for cybersecurity. `

#### `Since then, I’ve been diving deep into it, studying, experimenting, and falling in love with the field.`

When I finnised the first year of the course **System Administrator**, _I never got into any IT field before_. And I thought _hmm... It's interessting_. <br>
My classmates share a video in the class whatsapp group about a pentester doing a machine, thing that never seen before, and for me it was talking in Chinnese!!!<br>

And I thought, **OMG**!! Shouldn't I understand at least a little thing from what he's doing ¿?¿?¿? :flushed: :flushed: I am studing this.. or I think so... <br>
And there I got in love, and never stop viewing stremings from **S4vitar** :relaxed:
I leave some of his social:

- [github](https://github.com/s4vitar)
- [twiter](https://x.com/s4vitar?lang=en)
- [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgzsRmCl4BU-QmSVC4jFOlg)

I got in love with the so configurable **Linux** and start to play in **Hackthebox**<br>
By that time I made a video with my brand new **[Bspwm!!!](/blog/2021/first_contact_with-bspwm/)**... I was so happy! :blush: :smile: hehehe<br><br>
